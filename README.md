This is discontinued and kept up for personal reasons only.

Anyone can use this project as a whole or any part of it freely without any need for crediting or such, though why would anyone want to do that is beyond me.

# The old readme

This is a game engine with a room based map system using ncurses for visualization.
The classes of the engine (namespace Room_System) don't depend on ncurses library.

My Qt-creator can't open the terminal for ncurses, so I have been using external terminal. To use debug with Qt, comment the ncurses initialization lines from the beginning of main()
