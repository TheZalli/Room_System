This is a game engine with a room based map system using ncurses for visualization.
The classes of the engine (namespace Room_System) don't depend on ncurses library.

My Qt-creator can't open the terminal for ncurses, so I have been using external terminal. To use debug with Qt, comment the ncurses initialization lines from the beginning of main()
